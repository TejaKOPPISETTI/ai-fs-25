    Mushfiqur Rahim made a golden start to the 2025/27 World Test Championship
    (WTC) on the opening day of play between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at the
    Galle International Stadium on Tuesday(17/June/2025) in the first Test of a
    two-match series.<br>Rahim walked out to bat with Bangladesh in a spot of bother at 45-3 in the
    first session after the visitors won the toss and chose to bat. However,
    Rahim, alongside skipper Najmul Shanto Hossain, ensured that the team did not
    lose any other wicket through the course of the day and went into stumps in
    cruise control.
